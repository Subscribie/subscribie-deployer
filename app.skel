# app.skel is a uwsgi config file template
# Why .skel? It's to indicate that its a 'template' or 'skeleton' file - when a new shop is deployed, then, it gets used a a template and a valid uwsgi config file is created from it:
# But why .skel? It's inspired from from /etc/skel/Â on ubuntu which ubuntu uses when a new user is added (google ubuntu skel)
